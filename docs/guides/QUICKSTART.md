# Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Get Started in 3 Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd /Users/alexafal/Documents/Coding_Files/Python/Flow_App
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or if you need to use `pip3`:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the App

```bash
python app.py
```

Or:

```bash
python3 app.py
```

### 3. Open in Browser

Navigate to: **http://localhost:5000**

## 📱 First Time Setup

1. **Choose your goal** - Select what you want to improve (Productivity, Health, Focus, or Mood)

2. **Add suggested habits** - The app will suggest 3 habits based on your goal. Click to add them, or skip.

3. **Add your first task** - Type something like "Study at 7pm" or "Buy groceries tomorrow"

4. **Start using Flow!** - You're all set! The app will remember your progress.

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Natural Language**: Try "Call mom tomorrow at 3pm" - it automatically sets the date and time!
- **Swipe Gestures**: On mobile, swipe right to complete tasks, swipe left to delete
- **Daily Focus**: Set your 3 priorities each morning in the Focus tab
- **Habit Streaks**: Check off habits daily to build your streak! 🔥

## 🎯 Features to Try

1. **Add a task** with natural language parsing
2. **Create a habit** and check it off daily
3. **Set your 3 focus items** for today
4. **View your stats** to see your progress
5. **Complete all tasks** to see the confetti! 🎉

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Port already in use?**
- The app will try port 5000 first, then 5001
- Or stop any other Flask apps running

**Data not saving?**
- The `data/` folder will be created automatically
- Make sure you have write permissions

**App not loading?**
- Check the terminal for error messages
- Make sure all dependencies are installed
- Try refreshing the browser
