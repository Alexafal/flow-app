## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Understand the Evolution
Read these files in order:
1. `README.md` - Overview and how to use
2. `batch0-mvp/CHANGES.md` - The foundation
3. `batch1-smart-features/CHANGES.md` - Adding intelligence
4. `batch2-intelligence/CHANGES.md` - Adding complexity
5. `batch3-design-premium/CHANGES.md` - Adding polish
6. `COMPARISON_GUIDE.md` - Side-by-side comparisons

### 2. Run the Final Version
```bash
# Use the root directory (latest version)
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

# Or use batch7-enterprise-features snapshot
cd versions/batch7-enterprise-features
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Open: http://localhost:5000

### 3. Study the Code
- **Root directory** has the latest code with Batch 7 UX improvements
- **batch7-enterprise-features/** has the Batch 7 snapshot
- Read CHANGES.md files to understand what was added in each batch
- Use COMPARISON_GUIDE.md to see specific differences
