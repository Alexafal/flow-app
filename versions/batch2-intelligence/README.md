# Batch 2: Intelligence & Calendar - Documentation Only

## ⚠️ Note

This directory contains **documentation only**. Full code snapshots with `app.py` and complete project structure are available starting from **Batch 3** onwards.

## What's Here

- `CHANGES.md` - Complete documentation of Batch 2 Intelligence features
- `BATCH2_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Additional improvement details

## Why No Code Files?

The early batches (0-2) represent the initial development iterations where:
- Only documentation was preserved for historical reference
- Code was continuously evolved and merged into later batches
- Full snapshots became standard practice starting with Batch 3

## To See Actual Code

- **Batch 3+**: Check `versions/batch3-design-premium/` and later directories for complete code snapshots
- **Current Version**: See the root directory `/Python/Flow_App/` for the latest codebase
